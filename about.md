This blog post is for Project 2 Mobile Development. It contains a Weekly Diary (summary) of what I did each week as a mobile software developer/ Project team leader. It also contains an overview of what AGILE elements I used during each "sprint" of the mobile development assignment, how I showed professionalism towards the client and how I showed professionalism towards my peers. 

Code evidence has also been uploaded to provide evidence of the work I have done on the back-end of the project.
