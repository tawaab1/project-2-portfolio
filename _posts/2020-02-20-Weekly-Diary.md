## Week One

  This first I have been assigned as Project leader for Mobile Project 1 and 2, so I have sort out installations for the junior members of the team. I have to make sure that there repositories have been made and that they have react-native via expo installed on their machines (with the appropriate packages).

## Week Two

  The first project that we are working on is  the Enabling Love app. Attempting to get this app working has been a long process due to previous years poor documentation on how to access the app efficently. But since we have got it working we can now start to make some progress in update bugs/issues unfinished from last year.

## Week Three

  This week we are attempting to access the database because we want to know what is stored within it, before starting any code changes. We have also made several user stories and 'bugs' issues to get us started on the app. This sprint I have been assigned to making the login page/ register page more streamlined rather than using redundant pages that link them together. Also fixing a bug issue with the like button.
