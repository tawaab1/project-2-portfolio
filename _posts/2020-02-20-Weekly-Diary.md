## Week One

  This first I have been assigned as Project leader for Mobile Project 1 and 2, so I have sort out installations for the junior members of the team. I have to make sure that there repositories have been made and that they have react-native via expo installed on their machines (with the appropriate packages).

## Week Two

  The first project that we are working on is  the Enabling Love app. Attempting to get this app working has been a long process due to previous years poor documentation on how to access the app efficently. But since we have got it working we can now start to make some progress in update bugs/issues unfinished from last year.

## Week Three

  This week we are attempting to access the database because we want to know what is stored within it, before starting any code changes. We have also made several user stories and 'bugs' issues to get us started on the app. This sprint I have been assigned to making the login page/ register page more streamlined rather than using redundant pages that link them together. Also fixing a bug issue with the like button.

## Week Four
  So we have managed to gain access the database after contacting last year's students so we can see what data exists in the database. We also discuss about future sprints and what we are going to be doing over the coming weeks, while we work on the current sprint and issues that we have been assigned to

## Week Five
  Unexpected circumstances have occured this week halting the ability to work together physically with my collegues. I have sent emails to each of my team members letting them know that I will be available via email, Microsoft Teams and the audio/video chatiing app called Discord if they wish to stay in contact during this lockdown.

## Week Six and Seven
  Because of the current state of this lockdown, we have been ordered to stay home for 4 weeks before we are able to go back to any tertiary educational facility. The polytechnic has also decided to move the mid-term break early to this week and the next. Work on the project has been halted so our team members are able to gather themselves, and are able to ensure their own personal safety before starting back to work on the project. We have been adviced by our supervisor to work on our portfolios while on break and focus on the project once the second half of the semester starts back again.

## Week Eight
  Getting in contact with our client is the utmost priority this week. We want to assure them that we can work around this lockdown. We have showed them assurance by sharing information of what we have done so far, what we will be doing in the future but also taking their concerns into consideration, but also apologizing that it has taken time to respond during the lockdown.

## Week Nine
  This week I have been assigned new issues to work on such as working on the Share and Comment sections of the app and also reseaching on the Blog Post text only option (rather than having the user post pictures). I will also be updating the issues of on the github repository, so the team are aware of these changes/additions.

## Week Ten and Eleven
  This two weeks we are starting fresh with a new sprint. I will be focusing my energy to make sure Team standups/meetings are being met, encouraging my collegues during the lockdown and also asking them if there are issues they are having with the project.

## Week Twelve and Thirteen
This next two weeks we will moving along with starting a new sprint but focusing on improving on open issues from the last sprint. I will deliberate with the group on where they are at on the issues and if they have any problems that they are facing that they want to bring up. I will also be contacting the client to notify them on where things are at in regards to the app.
