## Goals

   My goal this sprint was being able to fix the like button issue, and removing the redundant main screen of the app whilst linking the login and sign up page.


## Agile Implementation

  ### Principle 7: Working software is the primary measure of progress.

  With the help of my collegues I also able to obtain a working version of the app. And assigning one of my collegues to write down a step-by-step guide on how to properly run t he development version of the app, we are finally able to progress in the development phase. I am also able to get the development version of the app working not only on my polytechnic machine but also my home, so I can work on the project from whereever. 

    This week I am focusing on fixing the like button issue (where it just showed the icon but it had no functionality) and removing the main screen of the app (which I considered redundant because it only housed buttons which links to the login and sign up page). I managed to get the icon to not only turn red when the Like button was clicked but also increment a Like counter everytime the Like button was pressed (counter also decrements when the button was unclicked).

    In terms of the main page, I reasoned that having a main screen that just housed buttons to a login and sign up screen seemed redundant (to which my collegues agreed). It would be better to just have the user directly interact with the login page to sign in. If the user wanted to sign in they could access the sign up page with a link at the bottom of the login screen. Commiting these changes ensures a more fluid access to the app.


  
  ### Principle 3: Deliver working software frequently

  In this sprint, I was able to complete my assigned issues within two weeks of progress. This allowed more time to help out my collegues on their issues and also keep in constant communication with the client if needed.

  ## What worked well for me?

  * Ensuring the delivery of a working app, with new features that I have been working on
  * The ability to help out my collegues with the spare time given to me after completing my assigned issues
  * Assigning spare time to update a weekly diary and sprint reviews for the current sprint


## What could I improve on?

  * Keep in constant communication with my collegues, while taking on additional tasks when finished with the ones I have been assigned to

## What barriers did I need to overcome?

  * To avoid procratinating although the proposed lockdown has been put into affect

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

  Next sprint I will be working on fixing the Comment section of the app and adding the Text-only post to the Timeline.
