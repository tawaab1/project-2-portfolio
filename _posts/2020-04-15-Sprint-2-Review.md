## Goals

   My goal this sprint was being able to access the database so we as a team can see what kind of data is stored in there. Also emailing the client and introducing myself to them as Project Leader for this year.


## Agile Implementation

  ### Principle 12: Team Reflection at regular intervals

  I am able to make myself available to my collegues wherever possible whether it is physically or electronically. I have made myself every Project class time for meetings/standups. I have also made myself available by email, Microsoft Teams and the audio/video chatting app called Discord.

  ### Principle 4: Business people and developers must work together daily

  As Project Leader, I have been doing my utmost to keep in constant contact with the client. This sprint I have introduced myself as soon as possible, so the client knows whom they are going to be working with this year. I have also assured my client that I would always be available to be contacted whenever appropriate.


  ## What worked well for me?

  * Completing tasks promptly during this sprint.
  * Getting acquainted with the client as soon as I was able to obtain their contact email


## What could I improve on?

  * Perform tasks faster and improve my time management skills so I do not fall behind tasks

## What barriers did I need to overcome?

  * I need to overcome shyness when it comes to being given responsibilities to perform in behalf of the group by the project supervisior

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

  To begin fixing primary issues that I have been assigned to in the sprint. I will be working on fixing the like button issue and removing the redundant main page while making sure the login page and sign up page are linked.
