## Goals

My goal this sprint was being able to research topics related to the issues that I have been assigned to. And as Team leader, help the group collaborate more with one another.


## Agile Implementation

### Principle 5: Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

A big priority as the assigned team leader for my mobile development group is keeping everyone motivated even during the national lockdown. I have done this by emailing and direct messaging(via Microsoft Team) my colleagues if they need help finiding resources to certain issues they may be facing, organising group video calls with the supervisor, but not putting pressure on them too much to get issues done, knowing that they have other assignments/projects to work on as well.


### Principle 12: At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

A vital aspect of team collaboration that we have been trying to get perfectly is meeting together at regular intevals. It is a vital source of gathering infomation from one another, boost morale and see where everyone is at. And as the lockdown proceeds, this has become a very important part of group dynamic. I think we as a group have achieved this the best we can given the circumstance. We are able to make Zoom video-call meetings, and if a colleague is absent, one of the others will direct message them on the details of the meeting to 
keep them up to speed with whats been happening thus far.

### Principle 4: Business people and developers must work together daily

Nearing the end of the development semester of the app. It is neccesary to keep in communication with the client, to let them know where the team is in terms of the development process and what features have been implemented and whats still in the process of implementation. As team leader I have taken it upon myself to email the client throughout the course of the development process so the rest of the team can focus on the issues that they are working on.

## What worked well for me?

* Improving the group morale, keeping tabs with everyone and see where everyone is on the Sprint
* Setting up meetings on appropriate times of the week where everyone is free
* Collaborate with supervisor to create Zoom meetings for the group


## What could I improve on?

* Improving researching skills in regards to features of react-native that I have not worked on before

## What barriers did I need to overcome?

* To avoid procratinating although the lockdown has been put into affect
* Lack of knowledge about the code we had to work with from previous years has caused syncing issues with updated code that we try to implement
* Limits to technology has caused us to rethink ways of sharing our code with each other so we can collaborate on issues 

## What do I need to do for the next sprint?

Working on previous issues that I am assigned to that have not been closed yet.
